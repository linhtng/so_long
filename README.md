## ðŸ’¡ About the project
This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.
In my case, the game is about a pink monster picking up all the keys to open the dungeon door and exit. 

![](so_long_small_map_demo.gif)

The game implements a [flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) -like algorithm to validate paths in a game map, ensuring that the player can reach all collectibles and the exit. A recursive function `is_path` looks for the target cells in the map array and return success if there is a connected path to it from the start cell. Initially, the start cell will be the player's spawning cell and the 1st target cell will be its closest collectible cell. Upon success, we run the same path searching function with the starting and target cells change from the next collectible to another, and eventually, from the last collectible to the exit.

### How to play
---
###### Maps
The game is able to play any map you want as long as it follow some specific rules:
* The map has to be a ``.ber`` file.
* It can only contain some of the following characters:

| Character | Object |
| - | - |
| 1 | Wall. |
| 0 | Empty space. |
| C | Collectable. |
| E | Exit. |
| P | Player starting position. |

* The map must be a rectangle surrounded by walls â€˜1â€™.
* It must have at least one collectable â€˜Câ€™, and only one player â€˜Pâ€™ and one exit 'E'.

See some examples in the ``maps`` folder of this project.

###### Controls
Use ``WASD`` to move. You can move in all directions but cannot move through the wall. After picking up all the keys, the door opens and you may leave. The shell will print how many moves youâ€™ve used to solve the map on standard output.

You can close the game with ``esc`` or mouse click at 'X' button.
